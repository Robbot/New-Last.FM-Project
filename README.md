# New-Last.FM-Project
Enhanced version of statistics scrobbled by Last.fm portal of music which I am listen to it.

At first stage I wish to duplicate the Last.fm portal with my data, then I will convert and merge additional periods of scrobbled data to MediaMonkey and Plex, which is not included in Last.fm
Later I am going add extra features not available within Last.fm like more graphs, more statistics and creating Spotify playlists.

Basic prototype webpage is already running but I need to add more HTML and styles to have it properly displayed.

TO DO
5. Future Enhancements
Authentication: Add user accounts for personalized stats.
Mobile Optimization: Make the app mobile-friendly.
Backup: Implement periodic database backups.
