# New-Last.FM-Project
Enhanced version of statistics scrobbled by the Last.fm portal of music, which I am listening to.

At the first stage, I wish to duplicate the Last.fm portal with my data, then I will convert and merge additional periods of scrobbled data to MediaMonkey and Plex, which is not included in Last.fm
Later, I am going add extra features not available within Last.fm like more graphs, more statistics and creating Spotify playlists.

The basic prototype webpage is already running at https://scrobble.rojek.ie.
